2. Fill out the health information form (age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.).
3. Click **Predict** to receive a stroke risk assessment.
4. Review the results and follow the recommended lifestyle adjustments.

### API Endpoints
Home Page

•	GET / → Loads the web UI (index.html)

Stroke Risk Prediction

•	POST /predict → Accepts user data and returns stroke risk prediction.

•	Input Format (JSON or Form Data):
```
{
  "age": 50,
  "gender": "Male",
  "hypertension": 1,
  "heart_disease": 0,
  "avg_glucose_level": 85.6,
  "bmi": 25.4,
  "ever_married": "Yes",
  "work_type": "Private",
  "residence_type": "Urban",
  "smoking_status": "never smoked"
}
```
•	Example Response:
```
{
  "prediction": "The person is at risk of stroke."
}
```

### **3️⃣ Deployment**
- Host for free on a number of cloud hosting sites: **Render, Heroku**, etc.

### Deploying to Render

1. Push the Code to GitHub
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push origin main
    ```
2. Deploy on Render

    1.	Go to Render.
    2.	Click New + → Web Service.
    3.	Connect your GitHub repository.
    4.	Set Build Command:
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    5.	Set Start Command:

## **📊 Dataset Overview**
The dataset comprises **5,110 records** with **12 features**, covering **demographic, health, and lifestyle factors** influencing stroke risk. Key features include **age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI)**, offering a comprehensive insight into stroke risk determinants.

### **🚩Challenges & Data Preprocessing Steps**
- **Handling Missing Data:** Rows with missing BMI and smoking status values were **dropped** to maintain data integrity.
- **Encoding Categorical Data:** Applied **one-hot encoding** for categorical variables such as **work type** and **smoking status**.
- **Addressing Class Imbalance:** No explicit balancing technique (such as SMOTE) was applied.
- **Feature Standardization:** Continuous variables like **age, BMI, and glucose levels** were **standardized** to ensure uniform scaling across the model.

### **🫀 Key Risk Factors**
- **Age (0.25 Correlation):** Stroke risk increases with age.
- **Average Glucose Level (0.13 Correlation):** High glucose levels correlate with an increased risk of stroke.
- **Heart Disease (0.13 Correlation):** Pre-existing heart conditions significantly raise stroke susceptibility.
- **Hypertension (0.13 Correlation):** High blood pressure is a major contributing factor.
- **Body Mass Index (BMI) (0.04 Correlation):** A weaker but present link to stroke risk.
- **Smoking Status (Former Smokers: 0.06 Correlation):** Former smokers exhibit slightly higher stroke risk compared to non-smokers and current smokers.

### **🫀 Takeaway:**
The most significant stroke risk factors are **older age, high blood sugar, heart disease, and hypertension**. Proactive management of these factors can notably reduce stroke risk.

## **📌 Summary of Findings & Real-World Impact**
Stroke is a leading global health concern, and early detection is critical for prevention. This project utilizes **XGBoost model** to develop a highly accurate stroke risk prediction model. The interactive web app enables users to assess their risk and receive **personalized health recommendations**.

### **🔑 Key Insights:**
- **Primary Risk Factors:** Age, glucose levels, hypertension, and heart disease are the most influential predictors.
- **Lifestyle Contributions:** Smoking status and work type also play notable roles.
- **Model Performance:** XGBoost was chosen for its high accuracy and performance in stroke risk prediction.
- **Practical Use Case:** Users can enter their health data to receive actionable insights for reducing their stroke risk.

Leveraging **machine learning**, this project provides a valuable tool for **early stroke detection**, empowering individuals to take **preventative action** before serious health issues arise.

## **🔄 Future Applications**
This model has promising applications across various sectors to enhance stroke prevention and intervention efforts:

- **Healthcare Institutions:** Integration with **electronic health records (EHR)** to identify high-risk patients and enable preventive care.
- **Public Health Initiatives:** Aggregated risk data can help policymakers and healthcare providers **identify at-risk communities** and optimize resource allocation.
- **Mobile Health Apps:** Embedding the model into mobile applications can provide **real-time stroke risk assessments** and personalized lifestyle recommendations.

### **🫀 Impact:**
By identifying individuals at high risk early and offering **customized recommendations**, this model can play a pivotal role in **reducing stroke prevalence** and supporting **proactive healthcare strategies**.
